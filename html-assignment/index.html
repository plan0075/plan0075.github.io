               <h2>About me</h2>

            <p>My name is <em>Alex Plant</em>, I was born in Reading, England on August 15<sup>th</sup> 1996. My mother and Father moved our Family to Canada right after I was born, hoping to make a better life for me, and my older sibling. About a year after I was born, my mom had my younger sister, and we all have lived happily in Ottawa since.</p>

            <p>I grew up with a love of technology, and the arts. When I was in high school I took a computer science and fell in love with it, hwoever I decided to pursue another passion of mine, dance. After high school I went on to teach Ballroom dance professionally, righ up until the pandemic hit. When it became clear I wasn't going to be able to keep doing that like I had before, I decided it was time to come back to school, and enrolled at algonquin college in the IMD program so I could go back to the love I found In high school, and so far, I am loving this program and everything I have learned. Learning about <abbr title="Hyper text Markup Language">HTML</abbr> in this course has reminded me why I fell in love with my computer science course in the first place, and I am so excited to keep learning more about this, and hopefully even more advanced subjects in web design.</p>
